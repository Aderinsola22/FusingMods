# FusingMods

This project is simply recreating the possible algorithm used in Netease game's LifeAfter attachment fusing system.
There is the regular version where you put it your input of what you want to fuse
and there is the auto version that immmediately runs the algorithm depending on how many times you want it to iterate 

notes:
For now Grade 1 fusing is unavailable will fix that later
